  This read-only file holds the complete command line for the process, unless the process is a zombie.  In the latter case, there is nothing in this file:  that  is,  a
  read  on  this  file will return 0 characters.  The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of strings separated by null bytes ('\0'), with a further null
  byte after the last string.
